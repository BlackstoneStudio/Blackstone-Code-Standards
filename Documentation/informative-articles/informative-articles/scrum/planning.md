# Planning

## Objective

The objective of planning in Scrum is to establish an action plan for the sprint, including goals, tasks, and deadlines. It also aims to ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of the sprint requirements and the objectives to be achieved.

Here are some general steps that can help:

- Preparation:
- Ensure that the Product Backlog is properly **updated** and **prioritized** prior to the Sprint Planning meeting.
- Invite all members of the Development Team and the **Product Owner** to the meeting.
- Objective:
- Start the meeting with a brief description of the Sprint objective. This provides a **clear vision** and shared **purpose** for the team.
- Review and select the elements of the Product Backlog:
- The Product Owner reviews the elements of the Product Backlog and explains them to the team.
- The Development team **asks questions** to clarify the elements of the backlog and ensure a **common understanding**.
- The Development team selects the backlog items that it **can commit to completing** during the Sprint.
- Create the Sprint Backlog:
- The Development team breaks down the selected backlog items into **smaller**, **estimable tasks**.
- Estimate the effort required for each task using techniques such as Story Points or estimation in hours.
- Make sure the tasks are **small** enough to be completed within the Sprint.
- Task planning and assignment:
- The Development team **collaborates to plan** and **assign tasks** to team members.
- Consider the skills and abilities of each team member when assigning tasks.
- Establish the product increment:
- Defines the **completion criteria** for the product increment based on the definition of "Done" agreed upon by the team.
- Establish the time required for each task:
- The Development team agrees on the estimated time required to complete each task. This helps to have a clear idea of the work expected to be done and to monitor progress during the Sprint.

Additional tips for Sprint Planning:

- Encourages collaboration and active participation of all team members.
- Keep the meeting focused on the objectives and avoid digressing into long or irrelevant discussions.
- If the elements of the Product Backlog are not clear, ask the Product Owner to describe them in more detail before the meeting.
- Always prioritize transparency and open communication between the team and the Product Owner.
