# Code Reviews
In this article, we will learn how to review the code of a pull request from GitHub.  
In order to perform the checks correctly you can take as a basis the documentation in the [Standards and best practices](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/) repo.

## Instructions

1. Choose a task on the project board that is in the code review column in [productive](https://app.productive.io/)

2. In the task feed there should be a comment from the developer with the loom video & the PR link:
