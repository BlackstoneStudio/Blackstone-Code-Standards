# How to report time on Productive

Reporting time on Productive helps us to calculate the delivery times to clients, assign people and decide the amount of projects we can take. Here’s how we’ll contribute:

- [1. Click on ‘Time tracking’ plugin](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/blob/master/Documentation/common-process/how-to-report-time-on-productive.md#1-click-on-time-tab)
- [2. Write the amount of time you were assigned to the task](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/blob/master/Documentation/common-process/how-to-report-time-on-productive.md#2-select-the-project---write-the-amount-of-time-you-were-assigned-to-the-task)
- [3. Verify the Date/time](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/blob/master/Documentation/common-process/how-to-report-time-on-productive.md#3-verify-the-datetime)
- [4. Write a message explaining the progress done](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/blob/master/Documentation/common-process/how-to-report-time-on-productive.md#4-write-a-message-explaining-the-progress-done)
- [5. Verify your work was logged](https://github.com/BlackstoneStudio/Blackstone-Code-Standards/blob/master/Documentation/common-process/how-to-report-time-on-productive.md#5-verify-your-work-was-logged)

**Use the format:**  
1d = 1 day (I was full time on this task)  
4h = 4 hours (I was half day assigned)  
30m = 30 minutes (I was just a moment assigned)

This is only to plan deliveries to clients. It’s not an personal metric.

## **3. Verify** the Date/time

**As needed**, you can continue logging hours as the task needed.

## **At the end of the day, you should have no tasks in "In Progress".**

You can view your tasks in "In Progress" in [Productive](https://app.productive.io).
