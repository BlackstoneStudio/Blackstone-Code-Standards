# Clean Code Guide

Clean code is not about whether code works or not, **it’s about code being easy to read and understand**.
Some important points to consider when writing a code is that it should:

- Be readable, meaningful and concise
- Reduce cognitive load
- Avoid  intuitive names, large blocks of code and unnecessary nesting.
- Follow Best Practices and Patterns
- Fun to write and to maintain

> This guide should not be treated as a 100% checklist, you can question this rules and concepts;  for example in functions you wanna split them reasonably, you should not over do it, **these are guidelines and recommendations, not hard rules you need to follow.**

## Key Pain Points

| **Name**  | **Structure And Comments** | **Functions** | **Conditionals & Error Handling ** | **Classes & Data Structures** |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Variables | Code Formatting            | Length        | Deep Nesting                       | Missing Distinction           |
| Functions | Good and Bad Comments      | Parameters    | Missing Error Handling             | Bloated Classes               |
| Classes   |                            |               |                                    |                               |

## Possible solutions

1. Rules & Concepts 
2. Patterns & Principles
3. Test-Driven Development

## Strong Typing

**Types** are not required to write a clean code but** they can help prevent errors and improve readability.**
