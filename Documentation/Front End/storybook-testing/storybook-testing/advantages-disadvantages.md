# Advantages & Disadvantages


---

## Great features offered by Storybook:

- **Simplify the Way Components are Build: **Storybook helps you build small components that can run independently and be added to the application when required.
- **Allows Building Components in Isolation: **You can develop components in isolation, which means that you are entirely focused on the component being built. You are not required to think about other parts of the application because every component in Storybook resides in a folder where there are files for implementation and testing.
- **Provides Standard Style Guide: **Storybook code templates are code snippets that can be used for development requirements. This can be used as a standard for developing your web applications.
- **Helps to Reduce Development Efforts: **Developers create components only to realize that it has already been developed. Components created in Storybook are documented and accessible to others, so your development effort is significantly reduced.
- **Chances of Identifying All Edge Cases: **Storybook UI development is effective in the long run when you can easily identify all edge case scenarios that your traditional development approach can miss.
- **Better Documentation: **With Storybook add-ons, you can document your entire component library or even save use cases as stories in JavaScript.

## Some few challenges:

- When you are integrating with an existing project, you must also **take care of the migration needs**.
- There are **issues reported in some of the add-ons** that impact the systemâ€™s performance.
- In case you maintain your components in React and Storybook, **the efforts are duplicated**.
- You must **rely on add-ons and decorators** to handle different data requirements.
